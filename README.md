# Shifter

Shifter is my dumping-ground for some reusable code I write, in an
attempt to put together a common set of tools for building
web-services in Scala, while not putting my brains on fire.

This project is being worked on while I work on an actual web-service.
Right now it's incomplete and shouldn't be used by anybody except
myself, as the API may break at any time.

See
[Wiki for usage and installation instructions](https://github.com/alexandru/shifter/wiki)
(just a stub at this moment).
